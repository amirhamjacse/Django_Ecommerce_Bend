To include **product categories** while keeping stock tracking and variations intact, we need to add a `categories` table and link it to the `products` table. Hereâ€™s the **optimized theoretical schema**:

---

### **1. Categories Table (`categories`)**
   - `id` â†’ Unique identifier for the category.  
   - `name` â†’ Category name (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).  
   - `description` â†’ Details about the category.  
   - `created_at` â†’ Timestamp of creation.  

### **2. Product Table (`products`)**
   - `id` â†’ Unique identifier for the product.  
   - `name` â†’ Product name.  
   - `description` â†’ Product details.  
   - `category_id` â†’ Foreign key referencing `categories(id)`.  
   - `created_at` â†’ Timestamp of creation.  

### **3. Product Variant Table (`product_variants`)**
   - `id` â†’ Unique identifier for each color-size variant.  
   - `product_id` â†’ Foreign key referencing `products(id)`.  
   - `color` â†’ Color of the product variant.  
   - `size` â†’ Size of the product variant.  
   - `quantity` â†’ Current available stock.  
   - `created_at` â†’ Timestamp of creation.  

### **4. Stock History Table (`stock_history`)**
   - `id` â†’ Unique identifier for each stock record.  
   - `variant_id` â†’ Foreign key referencing `product_variants(id)`.  
   - `date` â†’ Date of stock update (daily snapshot).  
   - `stock_quantity` â†’ Available stock on that date.  
   - `created_at` â†’ Timestamp of the record entry.

### **How This Works?**
âœ… **Category Integration** â†’ Each product belongs to a category via `category_id`.  
âœ… **Stock Tracking** â†’ Records daily stock data in `stock_history`.  
âœ… **Stock Forecasting** â†’ Query past stock trends to predict future stock.
